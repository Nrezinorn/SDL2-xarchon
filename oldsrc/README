X ARCHON

Description:  X ARCHON, as the name implies, is a clone of the original
(about 15-years old) ARCHON game.  And, it's for the X Window System.

Platforms:  my system is a Linux/Intel;  reportedly also runs on a
Linux/Alpha, AIX 4.3.2, Solaris 2.6, FreeBSD 4.0, and NetBSD 1.4.1.
If anybody successfully runs it on other platforms, please let me
know so I can write it here and be happy about it.

Requirements:  X11, Xpm, GTK+, pthread libraries.

Installation:  type "configure" followed by "make" followed by
"make install".  Or read the "generic installation instructions"
(yawn!) in the file INSTALL if you're really bored.

Documentation:  after installing, type "man xarchon".

Controls:  light side:  qweadzxc moves, tab fires;
           dark  side:  numeric keypad moves, return fires.
(Use Settings|Define Players dialog to change controls.)
