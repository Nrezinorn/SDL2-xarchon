old canvas modules:

shm prefix:  has the ability to work with shared ximages
(regular pixmaps turned out to better)

png prefix:  png stuff contributed by Matt Kimball <mkimball@xmission.com>

and-or prefix:  an attempt to replace clip masks with use of GXand and GXor
gc functions.  but it's even slower than clip masks.
